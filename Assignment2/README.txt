This file contains instructions on how to run WebServer.java: 


Compiling
===================================================================================
Use "javac WebServer.java" in a terminal of your choice (preferably from your IDE).
===================================================================================


Running
==============================================================================================
In order to run the program, two arguments need to be given: 
the port number and the directory. To be noted that if you try to input the wrong
port number or the directory (should be public), they will be overwritten with default values.
Those values are 8080 and "public". Now to run the program: 

"java WebServer 8080 public" for example.
==============================================================================================


What then?
===========================================================================================================
After you get an output indicating success from the terminal, 
go to a web browser of your choice and type in localhost:[port number you chose] i.e 
"localhost:8080/", which should redirect you to the main index page. Run the tests from test.py and then
simply type in whatever file you want to visit --> localhost:8080/index.html and so forth.

Regarding the uploading of images, instructions are in the report and a couple of notes below.
============================================================================================================


IMPORTANT notes: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case submitting the image is not working on the first try, you may need to click on the submit                |
button once more. Could probably be something related to the multi-thread but due to time constraint and lack of |
experience regarding it, we could not handle the issue.                                                          |
